Micro-average treats all classes equally, regardless of their size, while macro-average treats each class equally, regardless of the number of samples in that class.\n","\n","Micro-average is often used when we care about overall performance across all classes, and we want to give more weight to the performance on larger classes. In contrast, macro-average is often used when we want to evaluate the performance on each class separately and give equal weight to each class.\n","\n","\n","In addition to micro and macro averaging, there is another common technique for computing the F1-score called **weighted averaging**.\n","\n","**Weighted averaging** is similar to macro averaging in that it computes the per-class F1-score and then takes the average of these scores. However, unlike macro averaging, weighted averaging takes into account the number of samples in each class when computing the average. Specifically, the weighted average is computed as follows:\n","\n","- Compute the F1-score for each class separately.\n","- Compute the weight for each class as the number of samples in that class divided by the total number of samples.\n","- Compute the weighted average of the per-class F1-scores, where each per-class F1-score is weighted by the weight of that class.\n","\n","The weighted average is commonly used when the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that some classes have many more samples than others. In such cases, using the simple average (macro-average) would give too much weight to the smaller classes, while using micro-average would give too much weight to the larger classes. The weighted average strikes a balance between these two approaches by giving more weight to the classes with more samples while still taking into account the performance of all classes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a82d2dc3","metadata":{"id":"a82d2dc3"},"source":["When computing the F1 score for the leaderboard and the final challenge results, we will be using the macro averaging strategy."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9b8dd1b2","metadata":{"id":"9b8dd1b2"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
